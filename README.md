ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevan.

**Connecting with me**
I can reliably be available for realtime connections between the hours of 9 am - 4:30 pm PST -- other options are possible, I just need a little heads-up so I can plan around family realities.

**How I show up**
- I'm a positive, upbeat, kind human, who is a great listener and supporter. 
- I worked for years as a facilitator, so really know how to gauge unstated people-dynamics. (In fact, part of what motivates me now, is getting away from mind-reading and room-reading, and into simply being clear with each other, and hands-on in our work.)
- I'm a writer first, but am also a skilled public speaker and presenter. My degree is in Communications, and I've done newspaper design, yearbook layout, audio production, video production, graphic design, content strategy. I've run my own business, I've been a facilitator and coach.
- I take responsibilitity for my work, and aim to deliver quickly and well. I really like nerding out on deep-dive problem solving, unconventional solution and quirky side-routes to arrive at unexpected solutions. 
- I'm also a dad, to four kids, and I'm super involved and hands-on. As a husband, I really care about being there for my wife, and so really prioritize family. 
- Iâ€™ve been a full-time WFH-er since before it was cool (2013), and also did school-from-home in the 90s. 

**Commununication:**
- I appreciate authenticity and realness. I prefer friendly, genuine, personal communication; we're not corporate automatons. Tell me what's happening in your world, I'll share what's happening in mine; and then we'll get down to business. 
- I'm getting a lot better at sharing disagreement/dissent, but this hasn't always been the case; I tend to "people-please," especially when stressed.  Using non-violent communication practices, whether providing positive or constructive feedback, is my jam. Disclose what you see, what need you have, what value it connects with, and what you request.  

**What I need**
- Time alone, to write, listen to music, drink coffee, go for a walk.
- Encouragement, kindness, affirmation from people who know me.

- **What stress looks like in me**
- I  withdraw / shut down, or overwork to solve the problem. 

**Personality test stuff**
- Iâ€™m an Enneagram 2 â€” helper; but with strong wings in 3 and 4.
- My StrengthsFinder strengths are all about ideation, adaptation, empathy, interconnectedness and storytelling.
- My Birkman interests are  Persuasive, Literary, Musical.

**Other bits**
- I love music (songwriting, singing, piano, home production)
- I started by own business in 2022, so have been learning alot about entrepreneurship
- Jobs I've applied for and/or held: funeral home mortician, Canadian border guard, librarian, volunteer election scrutineer, pop-up skateboard-mounted mobile soft drink vendor
